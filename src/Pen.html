      <br>
      <p>This wonderful pen was hand made to deliver the
        smoothest writing experience.<br> Unlike typicall store
        bought ballpoints, this pen fits comfortably into any size
        hand.<br>The fit and finish of this product is second to none.
        <br>Be prepared to never think about shitty store bought ballpoints again.
        <br><br><br> For questions or concerns 
        don't bother asking. I don't want to deal with people.<br>
        I hate people.<br>
