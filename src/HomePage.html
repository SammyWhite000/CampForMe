            CampForMe is a student run website that will give recomendations for camping! <br>
            This will include camping gear, food recommendations, and great places to camp. <br>
            <br>
            In the beginning, we will only focus on places in Colorado, but with enough time we can easily expand to other states.<br>
            Not only will we give great camping locations, but also great places to go hiking! <br>
            With more time, there will come more recomendations, but for now you bastards will have to do with what we have. :)
